# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Detection Using MobileNetV2  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project focuses on detecting plant diseases using **MobileNetV2**, a lightweight and efficient deep learning model. The model is trained on a dataset of **healthy and diseased plant leaves** to classify different diseases accurately. The goal is to provide a **fast, accurate, and deployable** solution for early disease detection in crops.

## ðŸš€ Features  
âœ… **MobileNetV2-based CNN** for efficient classification  
âœ… **Pretrained model (ImageNet) fine-tuned** for plant disease detection  
âœ… **Data Augmentation** for improved model generalization  
âœ… **High accuracy** on validation datasets  
âœ… **Deployable** on mobile, edge devices, and cloud platforms
